             Pop Ups, Multiple Windows, Iframe
             Pop Ups
             Pop ups, modal, alerts, dialog, overlay —> anything pop ups on the web.
             we have 2 different way of handling pop ups, based on their structure

             HTML pop ups
             if the pop up is from HTML ve deal it as if it another another web element

             JavaScript Alert
             They come from JavaScript, mostly known as js alerts.
             Was can Not click on those alerts to see the html (inspect)
             To deal with non HTML alerts we have a class from selenium Which is Alert
             How to point alert ?
             Alert alert=driver.switchTo().alert() ; —> it is from Selenium
             And we have accept, dismiss, senKeys and getText method for alerts.
             alert.accept() ;
             alert.dismiss() ;
             alert.sendKeys("Eurotech Batch 5") ;
             alert.getText()) ;
             if there is no alert on the web page and we try to switch :
             NoAlertPresentException: no such alert
             Multiple Windows
             Tab and Windows
             In selenium there is no difference between tabs and windows.
             By default selenium controls one html page
             When we open the page first time it points that it points that page only
             When we open new tab/window, it will still be looking at the old windows
             To do any injection with new window we have to swithc to the new window
             Day10-Type Of Web Elements 32driver.getWindowHandle()) ; -→ this return some unique code belongs
             the current windows that we open with driver.get()
             Handle —> unique identifier for windows
             driver.getWindowHandles() ; — > return the set of string IDs the all open windows

             Day10-Type Of Web Elements 33Iframe
             No Such Element Exception
             1- Locator might be wrong or dynamic or not correct
             2- Not enough wait time
             3- There is a frame or iframe
             In html we can have one HTML page inside to another.
             This is made possible by tag <iframe> or <frame>.
             Using frames we can put inside the HTML.
             When we have with frames, selenium can not control what is
             inside the frame.
             We have to switch iframe first.
             When we switch to iframe it will not see the default page, until we
             switched back.
             We can only switch one at a time and cannot switch to grandchild
             directly.
             can not switch to siblings only parent to child.
